                                <h3>My Information Security Journey</h3>
                                
                                <p>Throughout this course on Information Security, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of various topics essential for securing digital infrastructures. One of the most intriguing areas I explored was risk assessment and mitigation strategies. I learned the importance of identifying potential vulnerabilities and establishing controls to protect systems from external threats. Incident response and disaster recovery planning were also highlighted, showing me how vital it is for organizations to have a robust plan for handling breaches or system failures. I particularly enjoyed learning about GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance, as it highlighted the intersection of security and legal frameworks that protect personal and sensitive data (Harris, 2020). These topics made me realize how security is not just a technical issue but also a regulatory one.</p>
                                
                                <p>My favorite topics included cryptography and data encryption, as they provided a deeper understanding of securing communication over unsecured networks. The methods of hashing, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and their practical applications in securing data intrigued me.</p>
                                
                                <p>Looking forward, I would like to learn more about AI and machine learning in cybersecurity, especially how automated systems can enhance threat detection and response times. I am also eager to dive deeper into penetration testing and ethical hacking to better understand the strategies used by both attackers and defenders in the cybersecurity realm.</p>
