                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Cybersecurity governance encompasses a variety of frameworks and laws that ensure the protection of sensitive data and operational continuity. Key regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA set the standard for compliance, while methodologies like risk assessment and disaster recovery are vital to organizational resilience.</p>

                    <h3>GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA Compliance</h3>
                    <p>The <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> is an EU-wide law implemented in 2018 to protect personal data and privacy. It mandates transparency, data minimization, lawful processing, and requires prompt breach notifications. Organizations must also assign Data Protection Officers and conduct impact assessments (Voigt & von dem Bussche, 2017).</p>
                    <p><strong>HIPAA</strong> is a U.S. regulation focused on securing protected health information (PHI). It includes rules for privacy, security, and breach notifications. Covered entities must implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (HHS, 2022).</p>
                    <p><strong>CCPA</strong> gives California residents rights over their personal data. Effective in 2020, it emphasizes the right to know, delete, and opt-out of data sales. It applies to businesses meeting specific thresholds related to revenue and data handling (California Civil Code, 2020).</p>

                    <h3>Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies</h3>
                    <p>Risk assessment is the foundation of cybersecurity planning. It involves identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts to prioritize risk mitigation. Strategies include encryption, multi-factor authentication, access control, and continuous monitoring. Frameworks like NIST SP 800-30 guide these processes (NIST, 2012).</p>

                    <h3>Incident Response and Disaster Recovery Plans</h3>
                    <p><strong>Incident Response Plans (IRP)</strong> define protocols for managing security events. They cover detection, containment, eradication, and post-incident reviews. Defined team roles and regular testing ensure effectiveness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP)</strong> focus on restoring services after a major disruption. Key elements include backup strategies, recovery point objectives (RPOs), and recovery time objectives (RTOs). These plans aim to minimize downtime and data loss (Wallace & Webber, 2017).</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Effective cybersecurity governance relies on adherence to data protection regulations and robust planning for risk and incident management. Organizations must balance compliance requirements with operational demands to build resilient, secure infrastructures.</p>
